### Session Entry
- Date/Time (UTC, ISO 8601): {{UTC}}
- Operator: Art + Codex
- Goal: Fix context carry-forward so a prior music topic (e.g., Maze 28) does not bleed into unrelated banter.
- Summary Logged (UTC, ISO 8601): {{UTC}}
- Commits (local):
  - `d239397 P19.4: Gate topic anchors to music/deictic followups`
- Root cause:
  - ProviderDirector injected `topic_anchor` and computed/injected library grounding on every addressed turn, including generic banter, which biased provider output to keep referencing the last music topic.
- Fix:
  - Topic anchors and library grounding are only injected when the message is music-intent or an explicit deictic follow-up (e.g., "that one", "when?") within TTL.
  - Generic banter no longer receives the continuity hint or library grounding blocks.
- Files changed:
  - `src/roonie/provider_director.py`
  - `tests/test_context_tone_tuning.py`
- Tests run + result:
  - `pytest -q` -> pass (`235 passed`)
- Issues resolved:
  - Prevented "stuck topic" behavior where Maze 28 kept appearing in unrelated conversation.
- Issues introduced/regressions:
  - None observed in unit tests.
- Follow-up next steps:
  1. If topic bleed still appears via raw context turns, consider context-turn filtering for non-music banter without weakening true multi-turn conversations.
